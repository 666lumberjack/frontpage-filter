# frontpage-filter

A chrome extension to filter by post type (link/self) and remove duplicate posts on Reddit. Currently can detect and remove duplicate links and filter only link posts or text posts. Functionality to recognise the same image hosted in different places and hide all but the first instance is currently work-in-progress. 

# Motivation

I have found that when subscribed to (or viewing a multireddit containing) several subreddits with a very similar theme (for example the pairings of /r/starshipporn and /r/imaginarystarships, or /r/machineporn and /r/mechanical_gifs) it is easy to waste time viewing the same link more than once. This addon is intended to hide all but the first instance of a particular link in order to avoid this. It is also being expanded with other logical filter options over time. 

# Limitations

1. Works only in old Reddit, on the desktop

# Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Enable developer mode in the Chrome extensions menu
3. Click 'load unpacked extension' and select the folder containing this repository
